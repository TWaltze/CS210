	;; A task is described by some code, data and stack area
	;; A context is used to describe the state of a task so that
	;; we can switch between them.

	;; Given the small hardware defined STACK memory the number of
	;; TASKS we support is limited by how big we want to make each
	;; tasks stack we will support 64 bytes of stack for each task
	;; so the maximum number of tasks is STACK_SIZE/64 which is
	;; 4

	;; we will dedicate the second page of memory to storing the
	;; context descriptor array

	;; TASK MEMORY STARTS AT $0300 and GOES UPTO and including $FBFF
